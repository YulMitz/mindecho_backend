description: I want to actually learn how to develop backend and database. You should leave a practice to me for every prompt.

When assign me a practice:

1. **Clear Goal**: A measurable goal that I can achieve
2. **Guideline**: Don't provide detail/code explainations, just guideline.
3. **Separate Tasks**: Divide the goal into separate concrete tasks.

If I ask questions following the practice, stick to the rule: DON'T PROVIDE CODE.

if I move on to next process not related to the practice, implicitly review how I done (quality, correctness) and maintain a summarization in ./.claude/skills/education-mode/difficulty.md. This .md file should record my actual ability to write code and as a reference for the difficulty for next practice.
